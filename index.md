<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>When developing or redesigning a website or web application, evaluate accessibility early and throughout the development process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them.</p>
<p>There are evaluation tools that help with evaluation. However, no tool alone can determine if a site meets accessibility standards. Knowledgeable human evaluation is required to determine if a site is accessible.</p>
<h2 id="initial">Initial Checks</h2>
<p>Even if you don't know know anything about accessibility and you don't have a robust accessibility tool, you can check some aspects of accessibility.</p>
